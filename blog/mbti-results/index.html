            <h1>MBTI Results</h1>

            <div class="box">

                <p>Welp, I took another one of those quiz. My result is <span class="bold italic">INFP</span>.</p>
                <p>In short, this label is generally:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introverted</li>
                    <li>Likes to See the Big Picture</li>
                    <li>Dominant Trait favors Feeling over Thinking</li>
                    <li>...and Prefers to Live in the Moment</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I dunno about "Type being Permanent" because mistype is a thing, so as the weighing scale shifting from one side to another (i.e., life experience). I also dunno if the MBTI thing is a serious thing or just for fun.</p>
                <p>The timeline of my mistypes to current type follows:<br>
                    ISTP > ISFP > *Years Gap* > INTP > INFP
                </p>
                <p>In Conclusion, I wanted to think I'm a INxP, but INFP suits me better. I know because I imagine viewing myself in an otherwordly perspective. It's shocking that the more accurate I answer the questions, the better the results. Although, INTP sounds superior to INFP, but that's just stereotype. I can think smart too, but leans to feeling since it's easier to relate and better for me.</p>

                <p>Note This: MBTI Type sole purpose is to help you understand your ideals and flaws. Not only to improve as a person, but to better control oneself.</p>

                <p>Edit 1: In Addition, my Ennagram is 4w5 and TriType is 469. Therefore, I'm an INFP 4w5 "The Seeker".</p>
